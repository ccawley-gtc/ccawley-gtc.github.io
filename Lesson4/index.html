	Welcome to Wild Rescues. Our mission is to rescue, rehabilitate,
	and release wildlife back into their natural environment. We are a
	nonprofit organization dedicated to helping injured wildlife.
	</p>

	<p>
	Our staff provides around-the-clock care for wildlife in need. We
	also provide long-term care for wildlife that cannot be released back
	into their natural environment
	</p>

<p>
Will you partner with us? We need caring volunteers to help care
for our animals. You can also donate, become a member, or become a
sponsor. Contact us today.
